# Project Integration Overview

1. **Integration with DJT-RS Code**

    This codebase has been integrated with portions of the DJT-RS code, and the overall workflow can be executed directly within the DJT-RS framework. However, it is crucial to note that even with the integration, careful consideration is needed when modifying data to ensure its rationality. You can download the Amazon dataset from [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html), while the Movielens dataset is already included in the files.

2. **Explanation of Experiment Files**

    We provide an overview of the general process and some grouping files that remain from our experiments. Some files contain our test data, while others include results exported from completed programs. Please be advised that these files are for reference purposes only. If you need to run specific experimental scenarios or comparative tests, please add the necessary experimental data.

Make sure to adjust this information based on your project directory structure and specific requirements. This way, your README.md file will provide a clear overview of the project integration and a guide on how to use the experiment files.
